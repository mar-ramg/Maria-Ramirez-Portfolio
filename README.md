# Maria-Ramirez-Portfolio
Maria Ramirez's Portfolio for other's to view projects of a graphic designer. 

# Description
This is the Module 2 Challenge from UTA Coding Bootcamp Assignment. The challenge is about creating your own portfolio website where you can show off your work and skills so far from this class. Later, I will add more flare and make updates to my website. 

# Usage
You can navigate to view my portfolio About Me, Work I've done, Resume, and Contact information as a Graphic designer.
