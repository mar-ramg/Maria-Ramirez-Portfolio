    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Ever since I was 4 years old I was fascinated by perfecting my drawing skills about horses. I remember vividly experiencing motivation, determination, fearlessness, and inspiration from artists to create my own. Throughout my 20 years of living, I have explored painting, ceramics, drawing, illustration, and digital art. I'm mainly involved in graphic design related from making logos to creating websites.</p>
    <p>I'm enrolled at San Joaquin Delta College to receive my Associate's Degree in Graphic Design and enrolled at the University of Texas at Austin to receive my Web Development certificate. I love to learn anything that has to do with art because there is something new because of how art is evolving.</p>
    <p>I'm an upcoming graphic designer with a lot of passion for art. As a designer, I strive to offer and help any client's dream with their brand in logos, business cards, websites, etc. I like to communicate with my client's projects for the result to come out with the best design solution. I'll let my portfolio speak for itself. Have fun clicking and scrolling!</p>
